# MarketX_app

After 36 hours of sleepless night and days we have successfully implemented the system for **Dynamic Entity Clustering**.
The name of our project is **MarketX**.
We have chosen the user as the entity and then clustered data based on 4 parameters namely age,gender,state, name.

Clustering occurs in real time and is easily configurable as well there by fulfilling all the objectives and providing all the necessary APIs as well.

And we have added **4 BROWNIE FEATURES**
1. Provided with an interactive UI.
2. If the user wishes he can club clusters as well.
3. Additional security feature preventing multiple registrations from the same IP address.Thereby fulfilling all the use cases as well.
4. Searching for a user profile based on parameters and even downloading the data based on clusters formed.
